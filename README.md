# dotfiles

Dotfiles are the customization files that are used to personalize your GNU/Linux or other *NIX system, such as Termux on Android, in my case.  You can tell that a file is a dotfile because the name of the file will begin with a period or a full-stop ~ a dot! Hence, the name. The period at the beginning of a filename or directory name indicates that it is a hidden file or directory.  This repository contains and showcases my personal dotfiles. They are stored here for convenience so that I may quickly access them easily on different or new machines or new installs.  Also, others may find some of my configurations helpful in customizing their own dotfiles. It has also evolved into somewhat of a global *NIX hacker, scripting and programming tradition, to display your dotfiles. 

There are hundreds of ways to manage dotfiles, and I haven't resolved on one method yet. When I do, I will note it here, and the reasons why I chose it.
